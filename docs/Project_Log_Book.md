To-do's/Fixables
Gesture Recognition Code:
- [X] Redundancy in code needs to be fixed. Was use for testing but its interrupting progress
- [X] Finish implementing Stateful Gesture Recognition, prove to have better responses
- [X] Implementation of Quaternion and/or Accelerometer Data instead of Euler Angles is needed
- [X] Clean noisy code and map gestures to actions in Fuction
