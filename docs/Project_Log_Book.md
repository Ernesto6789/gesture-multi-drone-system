To-do's/Fixables
Gesture Recognition Code:
- [ ] Redundancy in code needs to be fixed. Was use for testing but its interrupting progress
- [ ] Finish implementing Stateful Gesture Recognition, prove to have better responses
- [ ] Implementation of Quaternion and/or Accelerometer Data instead of Euler Angles is needed
- [ ] Clean noisy code and map gestures to actions in Fuction
